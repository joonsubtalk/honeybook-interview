Angular app

The task is to create a simple contact list that should look like the below mockup. Use our API at https://candidate-test.herokuapp.com/contacts

Requirements:
1. Use AngularJS.
2. Make sure the site is responsive
3. Make sure more details come up when you hover on a user (see the mockup)

Things to consider:
1. The search functionality is not required to work for this task.
2. Feel free to use a CSS framework like Foundation or Bootstrap
3. We prefer SASS. You can also use Less.
4. Keep in mind the response times from the server will vary (0-8 seconds).

### How to start test environment:
- npm install // installs dependencies
- gulp // will start localhost environment
- enjoy!
- Search bar should work filtering result
